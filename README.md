# DBMS-Mini-project

This repository contains the code from our Database Management Systems Mini-Project. 
As a part of this project, we aim to build a online bookstore using PostgreSQL. We aim to predict the genres of the book and the price using Machine Learning models. 
The tentative end goal of this project is a web-based UI.
